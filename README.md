# Simulator for Numerical Spiking Neural P Systems (NSNP Systems)

Generates Computation graphs of input NSNP systems.

For the Subset Sum problem input parameters are assigned in input_ss.py. For simulations of other NSNP systems you must assign the input matrices in nsnps.py

## Non-deterministic solution to Subset Sum (SS)

```sh
python nsnps.py gen_ss_non_det 
```

## Deterministic solution to Subset Sum (SS)
```sh
python nsnps.py gen_ss_det 
```
